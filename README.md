# ELEC291-Reflow-Oven-Controller

Reflow soldering is a method employed to mount surface mount devices (SMDs) onto printed circuit boards (PCBs). This technique involves applying solder paste to secure components onto the PCB's solder pads. After the components are temporarily fixed in place with the solder paste, the PCB is subjected to controlled heating. As the temperature rises, the flux activates, and the solder pellets melt, soldering the components to the PCB. This entire process is known as "reflow soldering." A common approach to heating the PCB is by using a reflow oven.

In this project, we will design, build, program and test a Reflow Over Controller using XXXXXX microcontroller
